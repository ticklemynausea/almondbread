- Parallel rendering using web workers for squeezing extra performance
- Download current view as image

## TODO

### Mobile version

The app refuses to run at all on mobile and shows a blocking screen, on purpose, to avoid anunusable experience.

It is a priority to implement usability on touch devices.

### Render stability

The app is somewhat unstable on heavy renders and sometimes crashes the browser tab. This should be fixed, although reloading the page will produce the correct results.

### Arbitrary floating point precision

Experiment with an arbitrary floting point math library

### Color palettes

Color palettes are really not well thought out. Some work should be put into choosing colors that produce good results.
